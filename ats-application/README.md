# 🚀 DETECH ATS - Setup Instructions

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file and add your Google API key:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Server
```bash
python api_server.py
```

### 4. Open Your App
- Backend API: http://localhost:5001
- Frontend: Open your `index.html` in browser
- Health Check: http://localhost:5001/api/health

## 🎯 What This Gives You

### ✅ **Complete AI Integration**
- Google Gemini AI for resume analysis
- PDF and DOCX file processing
- Intelligent keyword matching
- ATS optimization recommendations

### ✅ **Real Backend API**
- `/api/analyze` - Analyze single resume
- `/api/health` - Check system status  
- `/api/history` - Get analysis history
- `/api/analysis/{id}` - Get detailed results

### ✅ **Database Storage**
- SQLite database (auto-created as `detech.db`)
- Stores all analysis results
- File deduplication with hashing
- Complete audit trail

### ✅ **Production Features**
- Error handling and logging
- File validation and security
- CORS enabled for frontend
- Fallback when AI service fails

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User uploads resume** via your HTML frontend
2. **JavaScript sends request** to `http://localhost:5001/api/analyze`
3. **Flask server processes** the file and extracts text
4. **Google Gemini AI analyzes** resume vs job description
5. **Results saved to database** and returned to frontend
6. **Frontend displays** match score, missing keywords, recommendations

## 🌟 Features Included

### **AI Analysis**
- Match percentage scoring
- Missing keywords detection  
- Candidate strengths identification
- Improvement recommendations
- ATS optimization tips
- Category-wise scoring

### **File Processing**
- PDF text extraction
- DOCX document processing
- File validation and security
- Duplicate detection via hashing

### **Data Management**
- SQLite database for development
- Analysis history tracking
- Detailed results storage
- Easy migration to PostgreSQL

## 🚀 Deploy to Render

1. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add DETECH backend integration"
git push origin main
```

2. **Create Render Web Service**
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Set environment variables:
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` = your API key
  - `SECRET_KEY` = random secure key
- Deploy!

3. **Update Frontend**
Update your `index.html` to use the Render URL:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://your-app.onrender.com/api/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});
```

## 🔍 API Examples

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

### Analyze Resume
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/analyze \
  -F "resume=@resume.pdf" \
  -F "job_description=Software Engineer with Python experience..."
```

### Get History
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/history
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Add your Google API key to the `.env` file

### "No module named 'flask'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "File too large"
- Files must be under 10MB
- Only PDF and DOCX formats supported

### Frontend not connecting
- Make sure Flask server is running on port 5001
- Check CORS configuration in `api_server.py`
- Update frontend URLs to match server address
